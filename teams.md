Brief description of the intended research


## Magna Carta Libertatum

Repository: https://github.com/Magna-Carta-Libertatum/

Participants:

* [Kaylea Champion](https://github.com/kayleachampion)
* [Wm Salt Hale](https://github.com/altsalt)

**Description of the intended research:**

We propose to extend GrimoireLab as needed in order to support an analysis of software licensing. We seek to extract and organize license data collected from repositories, enrich it with category schemes developed by NGOs concerned with software licensing, and analyze the data longitudinally using both category-driven and text processing techniques.

*Potential research questions:*
* How is license usage changing over time?
* Can we detect dark patterns such as license ratcheting through automated means?
