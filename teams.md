**Description of the intended research:**
We intend to replicate the pipeline of this paper: https://softwareprocess.es/pubs/sahar2020JSS-Gitter-Issues.pdf accross more Gitter rooms to analyze how issue reports are discussed.

## MPR

Participants:

* Niranjan Hasabnis

**Description of the intended research:**

Using repository information, including metadata, along with some quality metrics to rank repositories based on quality. Towards that end, I am using Perceval and GitHub REST APIs to extract out necessary information.

**Description of the intended research:**

We are a team of five Master's Computing Science students at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) and are taking part in this hackathon as part of our *Software Maintenance and Evolution* course. 
During this hackathon, we will be taking a closer look at the maintainability and evolution-readiness of the GrimoireLab toolkit. 
To do this, we will be using the toolkit itself for analysis - e.g. Perceval for repository metrics, Graal for code metrics, and Kibiter for visualization. 
We will use this information in combination with issues experienced by other participants, GrimoireLab developers, and our hands-on findings to determine what components are the least future-proof and refactor those where needed. 


## NAP (previously team Natarajan Chidambaram)

Repository: https://github.com/pooya-rostami/Hackathon-21

Participants:

* Pooya Rostami Mazrae
* Natarajan Chidambaram

**Description of the intended research:**

We intend to extend an already existing tool about bot detection in GitHub repositories (Published in DOI: 10.1016/j.jss.2021.110911) and add it as a plugin to the existing grimoirelab tool to expand its functionality. Futher we would like to include some visualization for this specific functionality.
