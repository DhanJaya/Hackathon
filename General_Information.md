# General information for participants

## For participating

Please, ensure that you filled in the form at https://forms.gle/Rr2QbfWZmigxvwFa7

We will use to get names, email addresses, institutions,
and other informatio about all participants.
It is not enough that somebody in a team fills in it: all participants
should fill it in as soon as possible, if they didn't already.

## Communication means

The main communication means for the hackathon are:

* Email. Please, ensure you filled in your email address in the form.
If so, you will receive some messages from the organization, and you will have
access to the email addresses of other participants, so that you can enter into
contact with them if needed. Please, use these addresses only for matters
related to the hackathon, except that the other party gave you explicit permission
for other communication.

* Matrix. Please, answer to the first email message you get from us with your
Matrix address. You will be added to a Matrix room where we will post some information,
and will be able of interacting with other participants and the organizers.
If you are not familiar with Matrix, you can just go to [Element.io](https://element.io/get-started)
and donwload the mobile app, or use the web version.

* Videochat. Unfortunately we cannot offer you an specific video channel for the
hackathon, but for meetings of a few people (usually less than 8), you can open a room
at [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/), which is free, and powered by free software.

* Training sessions. For training sessions we will use Teams, with specific links that will be shared
with participants in advance.
